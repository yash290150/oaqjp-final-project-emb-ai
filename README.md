# Emotion Detection Application

## Project Description

An Emotion Detection web application that analyzes text and identifies anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and the dominant emotion.

## Note

The original course Watson NLP endpoint was not reachable from the local computer during development. This local demonstration therefore provides the same required function and output structure without requiring the remote endpoint.
